# graphit-ftphoneypot
This project was a university course project, it was about Attacking Behavior Co-Relation Using Honeypot.

This project uses https://github.com/ohmyadd/wetftp as a high interaction honeypot and converts the logs generated by the tools into a graph using neo4j database

## what i did with this project is
- collecting logs
- create a python script to convert the logs into a json format that can be imported to neo4j using (apoc.import.json)
- view the graph in neo4j

## Future work
- create my own honeypots for multiple services such as HTTP/SSH/...
- Understand Neo4j structure more and more (lol).
- Convert this project to a framework.
- Develop the log2json convertor.
