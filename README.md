# graphit-ftphoneypot
This project was a university course project, it was about Attacking Behavior Co-Relation Using Honeypot.

This project uses https://github.com/ohmyadd/wetftp as a high interaction honeypot and converts the logs generated by the tool into a graph using neo4j database.

## Project Functionalities
- Collecting logs
- Convert the logs into a json format that can be imported to neo4j using (apoc.import.json)
- View the graph in neo4j


## To run the project what you need is:
- Having python3 -_-.
- Install the latest Neo4j database version.
- Install the latest APOC plugins (So you can call the apoc.import.json procedure).
- Additional: ```pip3 install py2neo```, then modify bolt port and username/password of neo4j database so you can run the neo4j cypher queries within the script.

## Future work
### Short period goal:
- Understand Neo4j structure more and more (lol).
- Develop the log2json convertor.

### Long period goal:
- Create my own honeypots for multiple services such as HTTP/SSH/...
- Convert this project to a framework with real time monitoring.
